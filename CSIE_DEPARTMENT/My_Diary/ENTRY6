TODAY IS THE DAY. 
AFTER WEEKS OF PRACTICE, I'M PREPARED TO CHALLENGE PROF.LIN TO A MATCH OF TABLE TENNIS. 
RUMORS ARE THAT IF ANYONE BEATS PROF.LIN IN TABLE TENNIS, IT IS GUARENTEED THAT HE WILL NOT FAIL IN PROBABILITY. 
I DON'T REALLY MIND THE RUMOR, BUT THIS MIGHT BE A CHANCE TO PROVE MYSELF GOOD ENOUGH IN TABLE TENNIS.
