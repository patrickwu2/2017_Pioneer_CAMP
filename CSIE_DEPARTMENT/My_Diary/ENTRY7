THERE IS A CUSTOM IN CS DEPARTMENT. EVERY YEAR, THE KEY TO 103 WOULD BE CHANGED, AND THE NEW KEY WOULD BE HANDED DOWN TO JUNIOR STUDENTS. 
JUNIORS WOULD THEN FORGE FIVE COPIES OF THE KEY. 
HOWEVER, THIS YEAR, THE NEW KEYS AND OLD KEYS GOT ALL MIXED UP, NOW WE ONLY KNOW THAT OLD KEYS HAVE MORE THAN ONE COPY WHILE THE NEW ONE HAS ONLY ONE. 
HOW CAN I FIND THE ONLY NEW KEY?
