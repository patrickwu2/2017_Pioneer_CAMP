In every single house, there is one such door that shouldn't be opened, and you know it. 
What lies behind the door? 
Keys to treasures? 
Or maybe something greater? 
Or maybe, something worse? 
One thing is for certain, if went in deep enough and had a good look around, you will surely gain much. 
But only if you can find your way back. 
Now you feel the urge, don't you, to pry open the forbidden. 
Just remember, if you regretted doing so someday, just recall that, I WARNED YOU.
