THE PAST PILES US UP INTO THE PERSON WHO WE ARE NOW, SO SAYS SOME PSYCOLOGISTS. THE THINGS I'VE BEEN THROUGH
              THE BOOKS I'VE READ
IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ME
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT I'VE SEEN

A STORY I'VE READ I'M SHARING
NOW WOULD YOU MIND CARING

FIND ME IN THE DEFLATED ROOM
I'LL BE WAITING
