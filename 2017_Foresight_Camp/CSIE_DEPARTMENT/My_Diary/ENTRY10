A FEW DAYS AGO I MET TWO CLASSMATES AT THE FRESHMEN_AREA AND ASKED THEM WHETHER THE FINAL EXAM IS THIS WEEK OR NEXT WEEK. 
HOWEVER, THEY GAVE ME COMPLETELY OPPOSITE ANSWERS. NOW WHO SHOULD I TRUST? 
THERE SURELY IS SOME "TRUE PART" AND SOME "ERROR" IN THEIR WORDS, AND IF I AM ABLE TO SPOT THE DIFFERENCE, MAYBE I CAN FIGURE OUT THE REAL DATE OF FINAL EXAM BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.
