TA OF SERVICE EDUCATION TOLD ME MY JOB TODAY IS TO CLEAN UP THE TRASH CAN. 
I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS AN EASY JOB, HOWEVER, DUE TO MESSY HABITS OF CSIE STUDENTS, ALL KINDS OF PAPER, PLASTIC, GARBAGE ARE THROWN INTO THE SAME BIN. 
NOW I HAVE TO PUT THEM BACK TO WHERE THEY BELONG AND THROW OUT THE GARBAGE(NOTE ONLY THE GARBAGE BUT NOT ANYTHING ELSE). 
DAWDLING IS NOT ALLOWED, SINCE THE TA WILL CHECK AFTER I HAVE FINISHED MY WORK.
